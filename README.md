# Reinforcement-Learning
Machine Learning

Reinforcement-Learning with Q-learning to find the shortest path in a given network.

Definition: Q-learning is a model-free reinforcement learning technique. Specifically, Q-learning can be used to find an optimal action-selection policy for any given (finite) Markov decision process (MDP).

In the given example (see RL.py), we create a network with 9 points (knots). We then connect some of those points to one another.
We use Q-Learning techniques to find the shortest path to a given point (knot #8 in the example).

Finally, we will plot the alogrythmus until it converges as well as the shortes path.
